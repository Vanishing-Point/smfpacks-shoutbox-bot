# smfpacks-shoutbox-bot
A rudimentary chatbot for SMFPacks Shoutbox on Simple Machines Forum, written in Python.

Right now the bot only has methods for fetching new messages from the chat. As an option, it can also store a dictionary with some simple statistics.

This is very much a personal toy of mine. I've kinda only put it on here to try out how GitHub works. It's not really usable by others, and I don't think it ever will be.
