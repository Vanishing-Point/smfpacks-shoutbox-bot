# smfpacks-shoutbox-bot
A rudimentary chatbot for SMFPacks Shoutbox on Simple Machines Forum, written in Python.

Right now the bot only has methods for fetching new messages from the chat. As an option, it can also store a dictionary with some simple statistics.

It's not really usable yet. Use at your own risk.
